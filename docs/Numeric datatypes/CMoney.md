# CMoney Class

**CMoney** is especially useful for financial calculations, as it avoids the round-off errors associated with floating point data types. The **WinFBX** framework also provides **CCUR**, that implements a currency data type with 4 digits of precision after the decimal point. **CMoney** allows te use of 0 to 9 digits of precision (the default value is 2 digits) for a greater flexibility (some currencies have 0 decimal places, e.g. the Japanese yen, and some three decimal places, e.g. the Kuwaiti dinar). The number of decimal places defaults to 2, but you can choose between 0-9 by defining them before includind CMoney.inc, e.g. #define AFX_CMONEY_DECIMAL_PLACES 4. If you choose more than 9 decimal places, the output will be truncated. The internal storage of **CCUR** and **CMoney** differs substantially: **CCUR** uses a CURRENCY structure and **CMoney** a DECIMAL structure.

When using 2 decimal digits, the greatest possible value is +/-792,281,625,142,643,375,935,439,503.35. However, the formatting functions, **FormatCurrency** and **FormatNumber** can only return a maximum value of +/-922,337,203,685,477.58, which are more than enough for financial calculations, because they use a currency data type. For greater values, you can format the returned string by yourself.

The locale identifier defaults to 1033 (US), for consistency with FreeBasic numeric data types, but you can change it by defining it before including CMoney.inc, e.g. #define AFX_CMONEY_LCID 3082 (Spain). The locale identifier (LCID) instructs the methods of this class about how input and output strings should be treated. For example, if you choose the Spanish LCID, the formated string input and output will use a comma, instead of a point, as the dcimal separator, and a point, instead of a comma, as the thousands separator.

### Constructors

Creates a new instance of the **CMoney** class and assigns the value passed to it.

```
CONSTRUCTOR CMoney
CONSTRUCTOR (BYREF cSrc AS CMoney)
CONSTRUCTOR (BYVAL nInteger AS LONGINT)
CONSTRUCTOR (BYVAL nUInteger AS ULONGINT)
CONSTRUCTOR (BYREF decSrc AS DECIMAL)
CONSTRUCTOR (BYVAL cy AS CURRENCY)
CONSTRUCTOR (BYVAL nValue AS DOUBLE)
CONSTRUCTOR (BYREF wszSrc AS WSTRING)
```

#### Remarks

We can also use strings to set the value, e.g.:

```
DIM money AS CMoney = "1234567890.12"
```
--or--
```
DIM money AS CMoney = "1,234,567,890.12"
```

When using a locale identifier other than the default one, we may need to use different separators for the thousands and the decimal point. For example, if using the locale identifier for Spain we need to use "," as the decimal separator and "." as the thousands separator.

```
DIM money AS CMoney = "1.234.567.890,12"
```
