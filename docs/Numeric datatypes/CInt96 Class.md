# CInt96 Class

`CInt96` is a wrapper class for the DECIMAL data type. Holds signed 128-bit (16-byte) values representing 96-bit (12-byte) integer numbers. The largest possible value is +/-79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,335.

### Constructors

Creates a new instance of the `CInt96` class and assigns the values passed to it.

```
CONSTRUCTOR CInt96
CONSTRUCTOR CInt96 (BYREF cSrc AS CInt96)
CONSTRUCTOR CInt96 (BYREF decSrc AS DECIMAL)
CONSTRUCTOR CInt96 (BYVAL nInteger AS LONGINT)
CONSTRUCTOR CInt96 (BYVAL nUInteger AS ULONGINT)
CONSTRUCTOR CInt96 (BYREF wszSrc AS WSTRING)
```

#### Usage example

```
DIM int96 AS CInt96 = 1234567890
```

#### Remarks

As the bigger numeric variable supported by FreeBasic is a long integer, if we want to set bigger values we need to use strings, e.g.

```
DIM int96 AS CInt96 = "79228162514264337593543950335"
```

# <a name="Operator1"></a>Operator LET (=)

Assigns a value to a `CInt96` variable.

```
OPERATOR LET (BYREF cSrc AS CInt96)
OPERATOR LET (BYVAL nInteger AS LONGINT)
OPERATOR LET (BYVAL cySrc AS CURRENCY)
OPERATOR LET (BYVAL nUInteger AS ULONGINT)
OPERATOR LET (BYREF wszSrc AS WSTRING)
```

#### Examples

```
DIM int96 AS CInt96
c = 123456789
c = "79228162514264337593543950335"
```

# <a name="Operator2"></a>CAST Operators

Converts a `Cint16` into another data type.

```
OPERATOR CAST () AS BYTE
OPERATOR CAST () AS UBYTE
OPERATOR CAST () AS SHORT
OPERATOR CAST () AS USHORT
OPERATOR CAST () AS LONG
OPERATOR CAST () AS ULONG
OPERATOR CAST () AS LONGINT
OPERATOR CAST () AS ULONGINT
OPERATOR CAST () AS SINGLE
OPERATOR CAST () AS DOUBLE
OPERATOR CAST () AS CURRENCY
OPERATOR CAST () AS VARIANT
OPERATOR CAST () AS STRING
```

#### Remarks

These operators aren't called directly, They perform the conversion when the target is not a `CInt96` variable.

# <a name="Operator3"></a>Operator *

Returns the address of the underlying `DECIMAL` structure.

```
OPERATOR * (BYREF int96 AS CInt96) AS DECIMAL PTR

int96 -= 123
int96 *= 2
int96 /= 2

#### Remarks

The version OPERATOR - (BYREF int96 AS CInt96) AS CInt96 changes the sign of a decimal number.

```
DIM int96 AS CInt96 = 123
int96 = -int96
```

# <a name="Abs_"></a>Abs_

```
FUNCTION IsSigned () AS BOOLEAN
```

# <a name="IsUnsigned"></a>IsUnsigned
