# CCUR Class

**CCUR** is a wrapper class for the **CURRENCY** data type. CURRENCY is implemented as an 8-byte two's-complement integer value scaled by 10,000. This gives a fixed-point number with 15 digits to the left of the decimal point and 4 digits to the right. The CURRENCY data type is extremely useful for calculations involving money, or for any fixed-point calculations where accuracy is important.

The **CCUR** wrapper implements arithmetic, assignment, and comparison operations for this fixed-point type, and provides access to the numbers on either side of the decimal point in the form of two components: an integer component which stores the value to the left of the decimal point, and a fractional component which stores the value to the right of the decimal point. The fractional component is stored internally as an integer value between -9999 (CY_MIN_FRACTION) and +9999 (CY_MAX_FRACTION). The function GetFraction returns a value scaled by a factor of 10000 (CY_SCALE).

When specifying the integer and fractional components of a **CCUR** object, remember that the fractional component is a number in the range 0 to 9999. This is important when dealing with a currency such as the US dollar that expresses amounts using only two significant digits after the decimal point. Even though the last two digits are not displayed, they must be taken into account.

### Constructors

Create a new instance of the **CCUR** class and assigns the values passed to it.

```
CONSTRUCTOR CCur
CONSTRUCTOR CCur (BYREF cSrc AS CCUR)
CONSTRUCTOR CCur (BYVAL cySrc AS CURRENCY)
CONSTRUCTOR CCur (BYVAL nInteger AS LONGLONG)
CONSTRUCTOR CCur (BYVAL nInteger AS LONGLONG, BYVAL nFraction AS SHORT)
CONSTRUCTOR CCur (BYVAL bSrc AS BYTE)
CONSTRUCTOR CCur (BYVAL ubSrc AS UBYTE)
CONSTRUCTOR CCur (BYVAL sSrc AS SHORT)
CONSTRUCTOR CCur (BYVAL usSrc AS USHORT)
CONSTRUCTOR CCur (BYVAL lSrc AS LONG)
CONSTRUCTOR CCur (BYVAL ulSrc AS ULONG)
CONSTRUCTOR CCur (BYVAL fSrc AS SINGLE)
CONSTRUCTOR CCur (BYVAL dSrc AS DOUBLE)
CONSTRUCTOR CCur (BYVAL dSrc AS DECIMAL)
CONSTRUCTOR CCur (BYREF szSrc AS STRING)
CONSTRUCTOR CCur (BYVAL varSrc AS VARIANT)
CONSTRUCTOR CCur (BYVAL pDispSrc AS IDispatch PTR)
```

#### Examples

```
DIM c AS CCUR = 123
DIM c AS CCUR = CCUR(123, 45)
DIM c AS CCUR = 12345.1234
DIM c AS CCUR = "77777.999"
```
#### Remark

The constructor that accepts a DOUBLE value is particulary useful, because it allows to set the integer and fractionary parts at the same time with just a number, e.g.

```
DIM c AS CCUR = 12345.1234
```

# <a name="Operator1"></a>Operator LET (=)

Assigns a value to a **CCUR** variable.

```

OPERATOR LET (BYVAL cySrc AS CURRENCY)
OPERATOR LET (BYVAL nInteger AS LONGLONG)
OPERATOR LET (BYVAL bSrc AS BYTE)
OPERATOR LET (BYVAL ubSrc AS UBYTE)

```

#### Examples

```
DIM c AS CCUR
c = 123
c = 12345.1234
c = "77777.999"
```

The operator that accepts a DOUBLE value is particulary useful, because it allows to set the integer and fractionary parts at the same time with just a number, e.g.

```
DIM c AS CCUR = 12345.1234
```

# <a name="Operator2"></a>CAST Operators

Converts a CCUR into another data type.

```
OPERATOR CAST () AS DOUBLE
OPERATOR CAST () AS STRING
```

These operators aren't called directly, They perform the conversion when the target is not a CCUR variable. For example, when assigning a CCUR variable to an standard numeric variable, the CAST() AS DOUBLE operator is implicity called.

```
OPERATOR CAST () AS CURRENCY
OPERATOR CAST () AS VARIANT
```

The casts to CURRENCY and VARIANT allow to assign a currency value to a CVAR:

```
DIM c AS CCUR = 12345.12
DIM cv AS CVAR
cv = cast(CY, c)
```
--or--
```
cv = cast(VARIANT, c)
```

# <a name="Operator3"></a>Operator *

Returns the address of the underlying **CURRENCY** structure.

# <a name="Operator4"></a>Comparison operators

```
OPERATOR = (BYREF cur1 AS CCUR, BYREF cur2 AS CCUR) AS BOOLEAN
OPERATOR <> (BYREF cur1 AS CCUR, BYREF cur2 AS CCUR) AS BOOLEAN
OPERATOR < (BYREF cur1 AS CCUR, BYREF cur2 AS CCUR) AS BOOLEAN
OPERATOR > (BYREF cur1 AS CCUR, BYREF cur2 AS CCUR) AS BOOLEAN
OPERATOR <= (BYREF cur1 AS CCUR, BYREF cur2 AS CCUR) AS BOOLEAN
OPERATOR >= (BYREF cur1 AS CCUR, BYREF cur2 AS CCUR) AS BOOLEAN
```

#### Examples

```
DIM c AS CCUR = 1.23
IF c = 1.23 THEN PRINT "equal" ELSE PRINT "different"
DIM c2 AS CCUR = 1.23
IF c = c2 THEN PRINT "equal" ELSE PRINT "different"
DIM c3 AS SINGLE = 1.23
IF c = c3 THEN PRINT "equal" ELSE PRINT "different"

#### Examples

```

c = c * 2
c = c / 2
c += 123
c -= 123
c *= 2.3
c /= 2.3
```

#### Remarks

The version OPERATOR - (BYREF cur AS CCUR) AS CCUR changes the sign of a currency number.

```
DIM c AS CCUR = 123
c = -c
```

Or you can use the NOT operator:

```
DIM c AS CCUR = 123
c = NOT c
```

Other FreeBasic operators such AND, MOD, OR, SHL and SHR can also be used with CCUR variables, e.g. c = c AND 1, c = c MOD 5, etc.
