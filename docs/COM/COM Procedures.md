# <a name="AfxAcode"></a>AfxAcode

Translates unicode bytes to ansi bytes.

```
FUNCTION AfxAcode (BYVAL pwszStr AS WSTRING PTR, BYVAL nCodePage AS LONG = 0) AS STRING
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *pwszStr* | The WSTRING or CWSTR to convert. |
| *nCodePage* | Optional. The code page used in the conversion, e.g. 1251 for Russian. If you specify CP_UTF8, the returned string will be UTF8 encoded. If you don't pass an unicode page, the function will use CP_ACP (0), which is the system default Windows ANSI code page. |

#### Return value

An ansi or UTF8 encoded string.

#### Usage example
(Russian bytes to unicode string:

```
DIM cws AS CWSTR
cws = AfxUcode(CHR(209, 229, 236, 229, 237), 1251)
MessageBoxW 0, cws, "", MB_OK
DIM s AS STRING
s = AfxAcode(cws, 1251)
MessageBoxW 0, s, "", MB_OK
```


# <a name="AfxUcode"></a>AfxUcode

Translates ansi bytes to unicode bytes. This function works like the intrinsic Free Basic WSTR function, but accepting an optional code page.

```
FUNCTION AfxUcode (BYREF ansiStr AS CONST STRING, BYVAL nCodePage AS LONG = 0) AS CWSTR
```
| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *ansiStr* | Ansi or UTF8 string to convert. |
| *nCodePage* | Optional. The code page used in the conversion, e.g. 1251 for Russian. If you specify CP_UTF8, it is assumed that ansiStr contains an UTF8 encoded string. If you don't pass an unicode page, the function will use CP_ACP (0), which is the system default Windows ANSI code page. |

#### Return value

The ansi or utf-8 string converted to utf-16.

#### Usage example
(Russian bytes to unicode string and then to ansi):

```
DIM cws AS CWSTR
cws = AfxUcode(CHR(209, 229, 236, 229, 237), 1251)
MessageBoxW 0, cws, "", MB_OK

FUNCTION AfxIsBstr (BYVAL pv AS ANY PTR) AS BOOLEAN
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *pv* | Pointer to the string. |

#### Remarks

Will return FALSE if it is a null pointer.
If it is an OLE string it must have a descriptor; otherwise, don't.
Gets the length in bytes looking at the descriptor and divides by 2 to get the number of unicode characters, that is the value returned by the FreeBASIC LEN operator. If the retrieved length if the same that the returned by LEN, then it must be an OLE string.

# <a name="AfxGuid"></a>AfxGuid

Converts a string into a 16-byte (128-bit) Globally Unique Identifier (GUID). To be valid, the string must contain exactly 32 hexadecimal digits, delimited by hyphens and enclosed by curly braces. For example: {B09DE715-87C1-11D1-8BE3-0000F8754DA1}

If *pwszGuidText* is omited, **AfxGuid** generates a new unique guid.

```
FUNCTION AfxGuid (BYVAL pwszGuidText AS WSTRING PTR = NULL) AS GUID
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *pwszGuidText* | A GUID in string format. |

#### Return value

A GUID.

# <a name="AfxGuidText"></a>AfxGuidText

Returns a 38-byte human-readable guid string from a 16-byte GUID.

```
FUNCTION AfxGuidText (BYVAL classID AS CLSID PTR) AS STRING
FUNCTION AfxGuidText (BYVAL classID AS CLSID) AS STRING
FUNCTION AfxGuidText (BYVAL riid AS REFIID) AS STRING
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *classID, riid* | The GUID to convert. |

#### Return value

A 38-byte human-readable guid string.

# <a name="AfxSafeAddRef"></a>AfxSafeAddRef

Increments the reference count for an interface on an object.

```
FUNCTION AfxSafeAddRef (BYVAL pv AS ANY PTR) AS ULONG
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *pv* | The COM interface pointer. |

#### Return value

The function returns the new reference count. This value is intended to be used only for test purposes.

#### Remarks

This method should be called for every new copy of a pointer to an interface on an object. For example, if you are passing a copy of a pointer back from a method, you must call **AfxSafeAddRef** on that pointer. You must also call **AfxSafeAddRef** on a pointer before passing it as an in-out parameter to a method; the method will call **IUnknown_Release** before copying the out-value on top of it.

Objects use a reference counting mechanism to ensure that the lifetime of the object includes the lifetime of references to it. You use AddRef to stabilize a copy of an interface pointer. It can also be called when the life of a cloned pointer must extend beyond the lifetime of the original pointer. The cloned pointer must be released by calling **AfxSafeRelease**.

# <a name="AfxSafeRelease"></a>AfxSafeRelease

Decrements the reference count for an interface on an object and sets the value of the passed pointer to NULL.

```
FUNCTION AfxSafeRelease (BYVAL pv AS ANY PTR) AS ULONG
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *pv* | The COM interface pointer to release. |

#### Return value

The function returns the new reference count. This value is intended to be used only for test purposes.

#### Remarks

When the reference count on an object reaches zero, **AfxSafeRelease** must cause the interface pointer to free itself. When the released pointer is the only existing reference to an object (whether the object supports single or multiple interfaces), the implementation must free the object.

# <a name="AfxAdvise"></a>AfxAdvise

Establishes a connection between the connection point object and the client's sink.

```
FUNCTION AfxAdvise (BYVAL pUnk AS ANY PTR, BYVAL pEvtObj AS ANY PTR, _
   BYVAL riid AS IID PTR, BYVAL pdwCookie AS DWORD PTR) AS HRESULT
FUNCTION AfxAdvise (BYVAL pUnk AS ANY PTR, BYVAL pEvtObj AS ANY PTR, _
   BYREF riid AS CONST IID, BYVAL pdwCookie AS DWORD PTR) AS HRESULT
FUNCTION AfxAdvise (BYVAL pUnk AS ANY PTR, BYVAL pEvtObj AS ANY PTR, _
   BYREF riid AS IID, BYVAL pdwCookie AS DWORD PTR) AS HRESULT
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *pUnk* | A pointer to the **IUnknown** of the object the client wants to connect with. |
| *pEvtObj* | A pointer to the client's **IUnknown**. |
| *riid* | The GUID of the connection point. Typically, this is the same as the outgoing interface managed by the connection point. |
| *pdwCookie* | Pointer to a DWORD variable that will receive the cookie that uniquely identifies the connection. |

#### Return value

S_OK (0) on success, or an HRESULT error code on failure.

# <a name="AfxUnadvise"></a>AfxUnadvise

Releases the events connection identified with the cookie returned by the **AfxAdvise** method.

```
FUNCTION AfxUnadvise (BYVAL pUnk AS ANY PTR, BYVAL riid AS IID PTR, BYVAL dwCookie AS DWORD) AS HRESULT
FUNCTION AfxUnadvise (BYVAL pUnk AS ANY PTR, BYREF riid AS CONST IID, BYVAL dwCookie AS DWORD) AS HRESULT
FUNCTION AfxUnadvise (BYVAL pUnk AS ANY PTR, BYREF riid AS IID, BYVAL dwCookie AS DWORD PTR) AS HRESULT
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *pUnk* | A pointer to the **IUnknown** of the object the client wants to disconnect with. |
| *riid* | The GUID of the connection point. Typically, this is the same as the outgoing interface managed by the connection point. |
| *dwCookie* | The cookie returned by **AfxAdvise** that uniquely identifies the connection. |

#### Return value

S_OK (0) on success, or an HRESULT error code on failure.

# <a name="AfxWstrAlloc"></a>AfxWstrAlloc

Takes a null terminated wide string as input, and returns a pointer to a new wide string allocated with **CoTaskMemAlloc**.

```
FUNCTION AfxWstrAlloc () AS WSTRING PTR
```

#### Remarks

The new string must be freed with **CoTaskMemFree**.

Useful when we need to pass a pointer to a null terminated wide string to a function or method that will release it. If we pass a WSTRING it will GPF. If the length of the input string is 0, **CoTaskMemAlloc** allocates a zero-length item and returns a valid pointer to that item. If there is insufficient memory available, **CoTaskMemAlloc** returns NULL.

# <a name="AfxGetOleErrorInfo"></a>AfxGetOleErrorInfo

Returns the description of the most recent OLE error in the current logical thread and clears the error state for the thread. It should be called as soon as possible after calling a method of an Automation interface and will only succeed if the object supports the IErrorInfo interface.

```
FUNCTION AfxGetOleErrorInfo () AS CWSTR
```

#### Return value

The description of the error on success or an empty string on failure.

# <a name="AfxOleCreateFont"></a>AfxOleCreateFont

Creates a standard **IFont** object.

```
FUNCTION AfxOleCreateFont (BYREF wszFaceName AS WSTRING, BYVAL cySize AS LONG, _
   BYVAL fWeight AS LONG = FW_NORMAL, BYVAL fItalic AS UBYTE = FALSE, _
   BYVAL fUnderline AS UBYTE = FALSE, BYVAL fStrikeOut AS UBYTE = FALSE, _
   BYVAL fCharSet AS UBYTE = DEFAULT_CHARSET) AS IFont PTR
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszFaceName* | A string that specifies the typeface name of the font. The length of this string must not exceed 31 characters. The **EnumFontFamilies** function can be used to enumerate the typeface names of all currently available fonts. If *wszFaceName* is an empty string, GDI uses the first font that matches the other specified attributes. |
| *cySize* | Specifies the height, in logical units, of the font's character cell or character. |
| *fWeight* | Initial weight of the font. If the weight is below 550 (the average of FW_NORMAL, 400, and FW_BOLD, 700), then the Bold property is also initialized to FALSE. If the weight is above 550, the Bold property is set to TRUE.<br>The following values are defined for convenience: FW_DONTCARE (0), FW_THIN (100), FW_EXTRALIGHT (200), FW_ULTRALIGHT (200), FW_LIGHT (300), FW_NORMAL (400), FW_REGULAR (400), FW_MEDIUM (500), FW_SEMIBOLD (600), FW_DEMIBOLD (600), FW_BOLD (700), FW_EXTRABOLD (800), FW_ULTRABOLD (800), FW_HEAVY (900), FW_BLACK (900) |
| *fItalic* | Specifies an italic font if set to TRUE. |
| *fUnderline* | Specifies an underlined font if set to TRUE. |
| *fStrikeOut* | Specifies a strikeout font if set to TRUE. |
| *fCharSet* | Specifies the character set. The following values are predefined:<br>ANSI_CHARSET, BALTIC_CHARSET, CHINESEBIG5_CHARSET, DEFAULT_CHARSET, EASTEUROPE_CHARSET, GB2312_CHARSET, GREEK_CHARSET, HANGUL_CHARSET, MAC_CHARSET, OEM_CHARSET, RUSSIAN_CHARSET, SHIFTJIS_CHARSET, SYMBOL_CHARSET, TURKISH_CHARSET.<br>Korean Windows: JOHAB_CHARSET<br>Middle-Eastern Windows: HEBREW_CHARSET, ARABIC_CHARSET.<br>Thai Windows: THAI_CHARSET.|

#### Remarks

The OEM_CHARSET value specifies a character set that is operating-system dependent.

DEFAULT_CHARSET is set to a value based on the current system locale. For example, when the system locale is English (United States), the value is ANSI_CHARSET.

Fonts with other character sets may exist in the operating system. If an application uses a font with an unknown character set, it should not attempt to translate or interpret strings that are rendered with that font.

This member is important in the font mapping process. To ensure consistent results, specify a specific character set.

#### Return value

A pointer to the object indicates success. NULL indicates failure.

#### Usage examples

```
DIM pFont AS IFont PTR = AfxOleCreateFont("MS Sans Serif", 8, FW_NORMAL, , , , DEFAULT_CHARSET)
DIM pFont AS IFont PTR = AfxOleCreateFont("Courier New", 10, FW_BOLD, , , , DEFAULT_CHARSET)
DIM pFont AS IFont PTR = AfxOleCreateFont("Marlett", 8, FW_NORMAL, , , , SYMBOL_CHARSET)
