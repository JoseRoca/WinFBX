# CSafeArray Class

**CSafeArray** is a class that provides wrapper methods for the SAFEARRAY structure, making it easy to create and manage single- and multidimensional arrays of almost any of the VARIANT-supported types. The lower bound of a CSafeArray can start at any user-defined value.

Additional overloaded methods are provided for one and two-dimensional safe arrays, that are the ones most often used in COM programming.

# <a name="SAFEARRAY"></a>SAFEARRAY Structure

Represents a safe array.

```
TYPE tagSAFEARRAY
   cDims as USHORT
   fFeatures as USHORT
   cbElements as ULONG
   cLocks as ULONG
   pvData as PVOID
   rgsabound(0 to 0) as SAFEARRAYBOUND
EBD TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **cDims** | Count of dimensions of the array. |
| **fFeatures** | Flags. |
| **cbElements** | Size of an element of the array. |
| **cLocks** | Number of times the array has been locked without corresponding unlock. |
| **pvData** | Pointer to the data. |
| **rgsabound** | One bound for each dimension. |

#### fFeatures Flags

| Flag       | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| FADF_AUTO | An array that is allocated on the stack. |
| FADF_STATIC | An array that is statically allocated. |
| FADF_EMBEDDED | An array that is embedded in a structure. |
| FADF_FIXEDSIZE | An array that may not be resized or reallocated. |
| FADF_RECORD | An array that contains records. When set, there will be a pointer to the IRecordinfo interface at negative offset 4 in the array descriptor. |
| FADF_HAVEIID | An array that has an IID identifying interface. When set, there will be a GUID at negative offset 16 in the safe array descriptor. Flag is set only when FADF_DISPATCH or FADF_UNKNOWN is also set. |
| FADF_HAVEVARTYPE | An array that has a VT type. When set, there will be a VT tag at negative offset 4 in the array descriptor that specifies the element type. |
| FADF_BSTR | An array of BSTRs. |
| FADF_UNKNOWN | An array of IUnknown pointers. |
| FADF_DISPATCH | An array of IDispatch pointers. |
| FADF_VARIANT | An array of VARIANTs. |
| FADF_RESERVED | Bits reserved for future use. |

#### Remarks

The array rgsabound is stored with the left-most dimension in rgsabound[0] and the right-most dimension in rgsabound(cDims - 1).

The **fFeatures** flags describe attributes of an array that can affect how the array is released. The fFeatures field describes what type of data is stored in the SAFEARRAY and how the array is allocated. This allows freeing the array without referencing its containing variant. The bits are accessed using the following constants:

#### Thread Safety

All public static members of the SAFEARRAY data type are thread safe. Instance members are not guaranteed to be thread safe.

For example, consider an application that uses the SafeArrayLock and SafeArrayUnlock functions. If these functions are called concurrently from different threads on the same SAFEARRAY data type instance, an inconsistent lock count may be created. This will eventually cause the SafeArrayUnlock function to return E_UNEXPECTED. You can prevent this by providing your own synchronization code.

# <a name="SAFEARRAYBOUND"></a>SAFEARRAYBOUND Structure

Represents the bounds of one dimension of the array. The lower bound of the dimension is represented by **lLbound**, and **cElements** represents the number of elements in the dimension. The structure is defined as follows:

```
TYPE SAFEARRAYBOUND
   cElements as ULONG
   lLbound as LONG
END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |

| **lLbound** | The lower bound of the dimension. |

Remaks

Base64 is a group of similar encoding schemes that represent binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation. The Base64 term originates from a specific MIME content transfer encoding.

Base64 encoding schemes are commonly used when there is a need to encode binary data that needs be stored and transferred over media that are designed to deal with textual data. This is to ensure that the data remains intact without modification during transport. Base64 is used commonly in a number of applications including email via MIME, and storing complex data in XML.

# <a name="AfxXmlBase64Encode"></a>AfxXmlBase64Encode

Converts the contents of a string to Base64 mime encoding.

#### Return value

The encoded string on succeess, or a null string on failure.

VT_EMPTY and VT_NULL are not valid base types for the array. All other types are legal. The FADF_RECORD flag can be set for a variant type VT_RECORD, The FADF_HAVEIID flag can be set for VT_DISPATCH or VT_UNKNOWN, and FADF_HAVEVARTYPE can be set for all other VARTYPEs. For more information about the FADF_RECORD, FADF_HAVEIID or FADF_HAVEVARTYPE flags see SAFEARRAY Data Type. |
| *cElements* | Optional. Number of elements in the array. |
| *lLBound* | Optional. The lower bound of the array. |
| *pvExtra* | Points to the type information of the user-defined type, if you are creating a safe array of user-defined types.

```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *vt* | The base type of the array (the VARTYPE of each element of the array). The VARTYPE is restricted to a subset of the variant types. Neither the VT_ARRAY nor the VT_BYREF flag can be set. VT_EMPTY and VT_NULL are not valid base types for the array. All other types are legal. The FADF_RECORD flag can be set for a variant type VT_RECORD, The FADF_HAVEIID flag can be set for VT_DISPATCH or VT_UNKNOWN, and FADF_HAVEVARTYPE can be set for all other VARTYPEs.

# <a name="CreateVector"></a>CreateVector

Creates a fixed size safe array from the given VARTYPE, lower bound and number of elements.

```
FUNCTION CreateVector (BYVAL vt AS VARTYPE, BYVAL cElements AS ULONG, BYVAL lLBound AS LONG) AS HRESULT
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *vt* | The base type of the array (the VARTYPE of each element of the array). The VARTYPE is restricted to a subset of the variant types. Neither the VT_ARRAY nor the VT_BYREF flag can be set. VT_EMPTY and VT_NULL are not valid base types for the array. All other types are legal. |
| *cElements* | The number of elements in the array. |
| *lLBound* | The lower bound for the array. Can be negative. |

#### Return value

S_OK (0) on success or an HRESULT code on failure.

#### Remarks

**CreateVector** allocates a single block of memory containing a SAFEARRAY structure for a single-dimension array (24 bytes), immediately followed by the array data. All of the existing safe array functions work correctly for safe arrays that are allocated with CreateVector.

A safe array created with CreateVector is allocated as a single block of memory. Both the SafeArray descriptor and the array data block are allocated contiguously in one allocation, which speeds up array allocation. However, a user can allocate the descriptor and data area separately using the **SafeArrayAllocDescriptor** and **SafeArrayAllocData*** calls.
