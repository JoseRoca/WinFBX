```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **Font** | Pointer to a **IFontDisp** interface. To create the font you can use the **OleCreateFontDisp** method of the CAxHost class or the **AfxOleCreateFontDisp** function. The default font is SegoeUI, 9 points. |
| **BackColor** | Specifies the back color of the container. The default color is white. You can use the FreeBasic BGR macro to set the color. |
| **ForeColor** | Specifies the fore color of the container. The default color is black. You can use the FreeBasic BGR macro to set the color. |
| **LocaleID** | Specifies the ambient locale ID of the container. |
| **Silent** | Indicates the bind operation will be completed silently. No user interface or user notification will occur. |
| **UIDead** | Indicates whether the container wants the control to respond to user-interface actions. If TRUE, the control should not respond. Default value: FALSE. |
| **DisplayAsDefault** | A flag that is TRUE if the container has marked the control in this site to be a default button, and therefore a button control should draw itself with a thicker frame. Default value: FALSE. |
| **SupportMnemonics** | Indicates whether the container supports keyboard mnemonics. Default value: TRUE. |
| **OffLineIfNotConnected** | WebBroser control. The control support offline browsing. |
| **DlCtFlags** | A combination of following flags, using the bitwise OR operator, to indicate your preferences. Most of the flag values have negative effects, that is, they prevent behavior that normally happens. For instance, scripts are normally executed by the WebBrowser Control if you don't customize its behavior. But if you set the DLCTL_NOSCRIPTS flag, no scripts will execute in that instance of the control. However, three flags—DLCTL_DLIMAGES, DLCTL_VIDEOS, and DLCTL_BGSOUNDS—work exactly opposite. If you set flags at all, you must set these three for the WebBrowser Control to behave in its default manner vis-a-vis images, videos and sounds. |

**Flags**

* DLCTL_DLIMAGES, DLCTL_VIDEOS, and DLCTL_BGSOUNDS: Images, videos, and background sounds will be downloaded from the server and displayed or played if these flags are set. They will not be downloaded and displayed if the flags are not set.
* DLCTL_NO_SCRIPTS and DLCTL_NO_JAVA: Scripts and Java applets will not be executed.
* DLCTL_NO_DLACTIVEXCTLS and DLCTL_NO_RUNACTIVEXCTLS : ActiveX controls will not be downloaded or will not be executed.
* DLCTL_DOWNLOADONLY: The page will only be downloaded, not displayed.
* DLCTL_NO_FRAMEDOWNLOAD: The WebBrowser Control will download and parse a frameset, but not the individual frame objects within the frameset.
* DLCTL_RESYNCHRONIZE and DLCTL_PRAGMA_NO_CACHE: These flags cause cache refreshes. With DLCTL_RESYNCHRONIZE, the server will be asked for update status. Cached files will be used if the server indicates that the cached information is up-to-date. With DLCTL_PRAGMA_NO_CACHE, files will be re-downloaded from the server regardless of the update status of the files.
* DLCTL_NO_BEHAVIORS: Behaviors are not downloaded and are disabled in the document.
* DLCTL_NO_METACHARSET_HTML: Character sets specified in meta elements are suppressed.
* DLCTL_URL_ENCODING_DISABLE_UTF8 and DLCTL_URL_ENCODING_ENABLE_UTF8: These flags function similarly to the DOCHOSTUIFLAG_URL_ENCODING_DISABLE_UTF8 and DOCHOSTUIFLAG_URL_ENCODING_ENABLE_UTF8 flags used with IDocHostUIHandler.GetHostInfo. The difference is that the DOCHOSTUIFLAG flags are checked only when the WebBrowser Control is first instantiated. The download flags here for the ambient property change are checked whenever the WebBrowser Control needs to perform a download.
* DLCTL_NO_CLIENTPULL: No client pull operations will be performed.
* DLCTL_SILENT: No user interface will be displayed during downloads.
* DLCTL_FORCEOFFLINE: The WebBrowser Control always operates in offline mode.
* DLCTL_OFFLINEIFNOTCONNECTED and DLCTL_OFFLINE: These flags are the same. The WebBrowser Control will operate in offline mode if not connected to the Internet.

```
FUNCTION AfxCAxHostWindow (BYVAL hwnd AS HWND, BYVAL cID AS WORD) AS HWND
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *hwnd* | Handle of the window that hosts he ActiveX control. If you don't know the value of this handle, you can get it calling the **AfxCAxHostWindow** function. |

| *pMsg* | A pointer to a **MSG** structure that contains information about a message |

#### Return value

TRUE if the message was processed, FALSE if not.

#### Remarks

Active in-place objects must always be given the first chance at translating accelerator keystrokes. You can provide this opportunity by calling **IOleInPlaceActiveObject.TranslateAccelerator** from your container's message loop before doing any other translation. You should apply your own translation only when this method returns FALSE.

#### Usage example

```
' // Dispatch Windows messages
DIM uMsg AS MSG
WHILE (GetMessageW(@uMsg, NULL, 0, 0) <> FALSE)
   IF AfxForwardMessage(GetFocus, @uMsg) = FALSE THEN
      IF IsDialogMessageW(hWndMain, @uMsg) = 0 THEN
         TranslateMessage(@uMsg)
         DispatchMessageW(@uMsg)
      END IF
   END IF
WEND
```
