# CADOConnection Class

Represents an open connection to a data source.

A **Connection** object represents a unique session with a data source. In the case of a client/server database system, it may be equivalent to an actual network connection to the server. Depending on the functionality supported by the provider, some collections, methods, or properties of a **Connection** object may not be available.

With the collections, methods, and properties of a **Connection** object, you can do the following:

* Configure the connection before opening it with the **ConnectionString**, **ConnectionTimeout**, and **Mode** properties. **ConnectionString** is the default property of the **Connection** object.
* Set the **CursorLocation** property to client to invoke the Microsoft Cursor Service for OLE DB, which supports batch updates.
* Set the default database for the connection with the **DefaultDatabase** property.
* Set the level of isolation for the transactions opened on the connection with the **IsolationLevel** property.
* Specify an OLE DB provider with the **Provider** property.
* Establish, and later break, the physical connection to the data source with the **Open** and **Close** methods.
* Execute a command on the connection with the **Execute** method and configure the execution with the **CommandTimeout** property.
* Manage transactions on the open connection, including nested transactions if the provider supports them, with the **BeginTrans**, **CommitTrans**, and **RollbackTrans** methods and the **Attributes** property.
* Examine errors returned from the data source with the **Errors** collection.
* Read the version from the ADO implementation used with the **Version** property.
* Obtain schema information about your database with the **OpenSchema** method.

You can create **Connection** objects independently of any other previously defined object.

To execute a query without using a **Command** object, pass a query string to the **Execute** method of a **Connection** object. However, a **Command** object is required when you want to persist the command text and re-execute it, or use query parameters.
