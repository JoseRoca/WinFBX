# CFileSys Class

The **CFileSys** class wraps the Microsoft File System Object and provides methods to work with files and folders, giving your application the ability to create, copy, alter, move, and delete files and folders, or to determine if and where particular files or folders exist. It also enables you to get information about files and folders, such as their names and the date they were created or last modified.

#### Remarks

A path is complete and unambiguous if it provides a complete reference from the root of the specified drive. A complete path can only end with a path separator character (\) if it specifies the root folder of a mapped drive.

Assuming the current directory is c:\mydocuments\reports, the following table illustrates the behavior of the **GetAbsolutePathName** method.

| pathspec   | Returned path |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| "c:" | "c:\mydocuments\reports" |
| "c:.." | "c:\mydocuments" |
| "c:\" | "c:\" |

#### Return value

Boolean. The base name.

#### Remarks

The **GetBaseName** method returns a zero-length string ("") if no component matches the path argument. The **GetBaseName** method works only on the provided path string. It does not attempt to resolve the path, nor does it check for the existence of the specified path.

#### Usage example

#INCLUDE ONCE "Afx/CFileSys.inc"
DIM pFileSys AS CFileSys
DIM cwsName AS CWSTR = pFileSys.GetBaseName("C:\MyFolder\Test.txt")
