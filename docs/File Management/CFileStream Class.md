# CFileStream Class

Allows to work with binary file streams. A binary stream consists of one or more bytes of arbitrary information. **CFileStream** provides a stream for a file, allowing read, write and seek operations.

**Include file**: CStream.inc

```
FUNCTION Open (BYREF cwsFile AS CWSTR, _
   BYVAL grfMode AS DWORD = STGM_READ, _
   BYVAL dwAttributes AS DWORD = FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, _
   BYVAL fCreate AS WINBOOL = FALSE) AS HRESULT
```
```
FUNCTION Open (BYVAL pwszFile AS WSTRING PTR, _

   BYVAL fCreate AS WINBOOL = FALSE) AS HRESULT
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *cwsFile* | The file name. |
| *pwszFile* | A pointer to a unicode null-terminated string that specifies the file name. |
| *grfMode* | One or more **STGM** values that are used to specify the file access mode and how the stream is created and deleted. The STGM constants are flags that indicate conditions for creating and deleting the stream and access modes for the stream. These elements are often combined using an **OR** operator. They are interpreted in groups as listed in the following table. It is not valid to use more than one element from a single group. |
| *dwAttributes* | One or more flag values that specify file attributes in the case that a new file is created.<br>**_0_** = Prevents other processes from opening a file or device if they request delete, read, or write access.<br>**FILE_SHARE_DELETE** : Enables subsequent open operations on a file or device to request delete access. Otherwise, other processes cannot open the file or device if they request delete access. If this flag is not specified, but the file or device has been opened for delete access, the function fails. Delete access allows both delete and rename operations.<br>**FILE_SHARE_READ** : Enables subsequent open operations on a file or device to request read access. Otherwise, other processes cannot open the file or device if they request read access. If this flag is not specified, but the file or device has been opened for read access, the function fails.<br>**FILE_SHARE_WRITE** : Enables subsequent open operations on a file or device to request write access. Otherwise, other processes cannot open the file or device if they request write access. If this flag is not specified, but the file or device has been opened for write access or has a file mapping with write access, the function fails. |
| *fCreate* | BOOL value that helps specify, in conjunction with *grfMode*, how existing files should be treated when creating the stream |

#### Return value

HRESULT. S_OK (0) on success, or an error code on failure.

### STGM Constants

The STGM constants are flags that indicate conditions for creating and deleting the stream and access modes for the stream. These elements are often combined using an **OR** operator. They are interpreted in groups as listed in the following table. It is not valid to use more than one element from a single group.

| Group                       | Flag                  | Value      |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| Access                      | STGM_READ             | &h00000000 |
|                             | STGM_WRITE            | &h00000001 |
|                             | STGM_READWRITE        | &h00000002 |
| Sharing                     | STGM_SHARE_DENY_NONE  | &h00000040 |
|                             | STGM_SHARE_DENY_READ  | &h00000030 |
|                             | STGM_SHARE_DENY_WRITE | &h00000020 |
|                             | STGM_SHARE_EXCLUSIVE  | &h00000010 |
| Creation                    | STGM_CREATE           | &h00001000 |
|                             | STGM_FAILIFTHERE      | &h00000000 |
| Transactioning              | STGM_DIRECT           | &h00000000 |
|                             | STGM_TRANSACTED       | &h00010000 |

| Constant   | Meaning     |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **STGM_READ** | Indicates that the stream is read-only, meaning that modifications cannot be made. For example, if a stream is opened with **STGM_READ**, the **Read** method may be called, but the **Write** method may not. |
| **STGM_WRITE** | Enables you to save changes to the stream, but does not permit access to its data. |
| **STGM_SHARE_DENY_NONE** | Specifies that subsequent openings of the stream are not denied read or write access. If no flag from the sharing group is specified, this flag is assumed. |
| **STGM_SHARE_DENY_READ** | Prevents others from subsequently opening the stream in **STGM_READ** mode. |
| **STGM_SHARE_DENY_WRITE** | Prevents others from subsequently opening the stream for **STGM_WRITE** or **STGM_READWRITE** access. In transacted mode, sharing of **STGM_SHARE_DENY_WRITE** or **STGM_SHARE_EXCLUSIVE** can significantly improve performance because they do not require snapshots. |
| **STGM_SHARE_EXCLUSIVE** | Prevents others from subsequently opening the stream in **STGM_READ** mode. |
| **STGM_CREATE** | Indicates that an existing stream should be removed before the new stream replaces it. A new stream is created when this flag is specified only if the existing stream has been successfully removed. This flag cannot be used with open operations. |
| **STGM_FAILIFTHERE** | Causes the create operation to fail if an existing stream with the specified name exists. In this case, **STG_E_FILEALREADYEXISTS** is returned. This is the default creation mode; that is, if no other create flag is specified, **STGM_FAILIFTHERE** is implied. |
| **STGM_DIRECT** | Indicates that, in direct mode, each change to a stream element is written as it occurs. This is the default if neither **STGM_DIRECT** nor **STGM_TRANSACTED** is specified. |
| **STGM_TRANSACTED** | Indicates that, in transacted mode, changes are buffered and written only if an explicit commit operation is called. To ignore the changes, call the **Revert** method. |

The *grfMode* and *fCreate* parameters work together to specify how the function should behave with respect to existing files.

| grfMode          | fCreate | File exists? | Behavior |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------ | -------- |
| STGM_CREATE      | Ignored | Yes          | The file is recreated. |
| STGM_CREATE      | Ignored | No           | The file is created. |
| STGM_FAILIFTHERE | FALSE   | Yes          | The file is opened. |
| STGM_FAILIFTHERE | FALSE   | No           | The call fails. |
| STGM_FAILIFTHERE | TRUE    | Yes          | The call fails. |
| STGM_FAILIFTHERE | TRUE    | No           | The file is created. |

| *pstatstg* | Pointer to a **STATSTG** structure where this method places information about this stream. |
| *grfStatFlag* | DWORD. Specifies that this method does not return some of the members in the **STATSTG** structure, thus saving a memory allocation operation.

# <a name="Clone"></a>Clone

Creates a new stream with its own seek pointer that references the same bytes as the original stream. The **Clone** method creates a new stream for accessing the same bytes but using a separate seek pointer. The new stream sees the same data as the source-stream. Changes written to one stream are immediately visible in the other. Range locking is shared between the streams. The initial setting of the seek pointer in the cloned stream instance is the same as the current setting of the seek pointer in the original stream at the time of the clone operation.

```
FUNCTION Clone (BYVAL ppstm AS IStream PTR PTR) AS HRESULT
