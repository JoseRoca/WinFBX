#### File Attribute Constants

File attributes are metadata values stored by the file system on disk and are used by the system and are available to developers via various file I/O APIs.

| Attribute  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE | A file or directory that is an archive file or directory. Applications typically use this attribute to mark files for backup or removal. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE | This value is reserved for system use. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY | The handle that identifies a directory. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ENCRYPTED | A file or directory that is encrypted. For a file, all data streams in the file are encrypted. For a directory, encryption is the default for newly created files and subdirectories. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN | The file or directory is hidden. It is not included in an ordinary directory listing. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_INTEGRITY_STREAM | The directory or user data stream is configured with integrity (only supported on ReFS volumes). It is not included in an ordinary directory listing. The integrity setting persists with the file if it's renamed. If a file is copied the destination file will have integrity set if either the source file or destination directory have integrity set. Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP: This flag is not supported until Windows Server 2012. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL | A file that does not have other attributes set. This attribute is valid only when used alone. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NOT_CONTENT_INDEXED | The file or directory is not to be indexed by the content indexing service. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NO_SCRUB_DATA | The user data stream not to be read by the background data integrity scanner (AKA scrubber). When set on a directory it only provides inheritance. This flag is only supported on Storage Spaces and ReFS volumes. It is not included in an ordinary directory listing. Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP: This flag is not supported until Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_OFFLINE | The data of a file is not available immediately. This attribute indicates that the file data is physically moved to offline storage. This attribute is used by Remote Storage, which is the hierarchical storage management software. Applications should not arbitrarily change this attribute. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY | A file that is read-only. Applications can read the file, but cannot write to it or delete it. This attribute is not honored on directories. For more information, see You cannot view or change the Read-only or the System attributes of folders in Windows Server 2003, in Windows XP, in Windows Vista or in Windows 7. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_REPARSE_POINT | A file or directory that has an associated reparse point, or a file that is a symbolic link. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SPARSE_FILE | A file that is a sparse file. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM | A file or directory that the operating system uses a part of, or uses exclusively. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_TEMPORARY | A file that is being used for temporary storage. File systems avoid writing data back to mass storage if sufficient cache memory is available, because typically, an application deletes a temporary file after the handle is closed. In that scenario, the system can entirely avoid writing the data. Otherwise, the data is written after the handle is closed. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_VIRTUAL | This value is reserved for system use. |

#### Remarks

The FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SPARSE_FILE attribute on the file is set if any of the streams of the file have ever been sparse.

# <a name="FileExt"></a>FileExt

Call this method to get the extesion of the found file.

```
FUNCTION FileExt () AS CWSTR
```

#### Return value

The extension of the most-recently-found filen. For example, calling FileExt to generate a user message about the file c:\myhtml\myfile.txt returns txt.

# <a name="FileName"></a>FileName

Call this method to get the title of the found file.

```
FUNCTION FileName () AS CWSTR
```

#### Return value

The name of the most-recently-found file, including the extension. For example, calling FileName to generate a user message about the file c:\myhtml\myfile.txt returns the file name myfile.txt.

# <a name="FileNameX"></a>FileNameX

Call this method to get the name of the found file.

```
FUNCTION FileNameX () AS CWSTR
```

#### Return value

The name of the most-recently-found file, excluding the extension. For example, calling FileNameX to generate a user message about the file c:\myhtml\myfile.txt returns the file name myfile.

# <a name="FilePath"></a>FilePath

Call this method to get the entire path of the found file.

```
FUNCTION FilePath () AS CWSTR
```

# <a name="FileSize"></a>FileSize

Call this method to get the size of the found file, in bytes.

```
FUNCTION FileSize  () AS ULONGLONG
```

# <a name="FileURL"></a>FileURL

Call this member function to retrieve the URL of the file.

```
FUNCTION FileURL () AS CWSTR
```

#### Remark

**FileURL** is similar to the member function **FilePath**, except that it returns the URL in the form file:\//path. For example, calling FileURL to get the complete URL for myfile.txt returns the URL file:\//c:\myhtml\myfile.txt.

# <a name="FindFile"></a>FindFile

Call this function to open a file search.

```
UNCTION FindFile (BYREF wszFileSpec AS WSTRING) AS LONG_PTR
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *wszFileSpec* | A string containing the name of the file to find (must not end in a trailing backslash). If you pass an empty string, FindFile does a wildcard (*.*) search.<br>If the string ends with a wildcard, period (.), or directory name, the user must have access permissions to the root and all subdirectories on the path.<br>To extend the MAX_PATH limit to 32,767 wide characters, prepend "\\?\" to the path. |

#### Return value

S_OK on success or an error code on failure. To get extended error information, call **GetLastError**. If the function fails because no matching files can be found, the GetLastError function returns ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND.

# <a name="FindNext"></a>FindNext

Call this method to continue a file search from a previous call to FindFile.

```
FUNCTION FindNext () AS LONG
```

#### Return value

Nonzero if there are more files; zero if the file found is the last one in the directory or if an error occurred. To get extended error information, call **GetLastError**. If the file found is the last file in the directory, or if no matching files can be  found, the **GetLastError** function returns ERROR_NO_MORE_FILES.

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *dwMask* | Specifies one or more file attributes, identified in the WIN32_FIND_DATAW structure, for the found file. To search for multiple attributes, use the bitwise OR operator. |

Any combination of the following attributes is acceptable:

| Attribute  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE | The file is an archive file. Applications use this attribute to mark files for backup or removal. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_COMPRESSED | The file or directory is compressed. For a file, this means that all of the data in the file is compressed. For a directory, this means that compression is the default for newly created files and subdirectories. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY | The file is a directory. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL | The file has no other attributes set. This attribute is valid only if used alone. All other file attributes override this attribute. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN | The file is hidden. It is not to be included in an ordinary directory listing. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY | The file is read only. Applications can read the file but cannot write to it or delete it. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM | The file is part of or is used exclusively by the operating system. |
| FILE_ATTRIBUTE_TEMPORARY | The file is being used for temporary storage. Applications should write to the file only if absolutely necessary. Most of the file's data remains in memory without being flushed to the media because the file will soon be deleted. |
