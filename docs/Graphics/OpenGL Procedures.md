# OpenGL Procedures

Assorted helper OpenGL procedures.

Freeglut 2.8.1 includes twenty two routines for generating easily-recognizable 3-d geometric objects. These routines are effectively the same ones that are included in the GLUT library, and reflect the functionality available in the aux toolkit described in the OpenGL Programmer's Guide. They are included to allow programmers to create with a single line of code a three-dimensional object which can be used to test a variety of OpenGL functionality.  None of the routines generates a display list for the object which it draws. The functions generate normals appropriate for lighting but, except for the teapot functions, do not generate texture coordinates. Do note that depth testing (GL_LESS) should be enabled for the correct drawing of the nonconvex objects, i.e., the glutTorus and glutTeapot.

I have adapted these routines to FreeBasic and grouped them in the include file AfxGlut.inc

To load textures for use with OpenGL, both from disk or a resource file, you can use the overloaded wrapper function **AfxGdipLoadTexture**, included in the file AfxGdiPlus.inc.

Renders a dodecahedron whose corners are each a distance of sqrt(3) from the origin. The length of each side is sqrt(5)-1. There are twenty corners; interestingly enough, eight of them coincide with the corners of a cube with sizes of length 2.

The above example can also be used as a template for OpenGL programming with Windows. You simply have to change the code in the SetupScene, ResizeScene, RenderScene, ProcessKeystrokes and ProcessMouse methods, and the private instance variables.
