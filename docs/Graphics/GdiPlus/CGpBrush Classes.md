# CGpBrush Class

The **CGpBrush** class is a base interface that defines a **Brush** object. A **Brush** object is used to paint the interior of graphics shapes, such as rectangles, ellipses, pies, polygons, and paths. You must not instantiate the **CGpBrush** class, but to use one of its derived classes.

A closed shape, such as a rectangle or an ellipse, consists of an outline and an interior. The outline is drawn with a pen and the interior is filled with a brush. GDI+ provides several brush classes for filling the interiors of closed shapes: **CGpSolidBrush**, **CGpHatchBrush**, **CGpTextureBrush**, **CGpLinearGradientBrush**, and **CGpPathGradientBrush**. All of these classes inherit from the **CGpBrush** class.

**Inherits from**: CGpBase.

# CGpLinearGradientBrush Class

Defines a brush that paints a color gradient in which the color changes evenly from the starting boundary line of the linear gradient brush to the ending boundary line of the linear gradient brush. The boundary lines of a linear gradient brush are two parallel straight lines. The color gradient is perpendicular to the boundary lines of the linear gradient brush, changing gradually across the stroke from the starting boundary line to the ending boundary line. The color gradient has one color at the starting boundary line and another color at the ending boundary line.

```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *point1* | Reference to a **GpPoint** structure that specifies the starting point of the gradient. The starting boundary line passes through the starting point. |
| *point2* | Reference to a **GpPoint** structure that specifies the ending point of the gradient. The ending boundary line passes through the ending point. |
| *color1* | An ARGB value that specifies the color at the starting boundary line of this linear gradient brush. |
| *color2* | An ARGB value that specifies the color at the ending boundary line of this linear gradient brush. |
| *rc* | Reference to a rectangle that specifies the starting and ending points of the gradient. The upper-left corner of the rectangle is the starting point. The lower-right corner is the ending point. |
| *mode* | Element of the **LinearGradientMode** enumeration that specifies the direction of the gradient. |
| *angle* | Real number that, if *isAngleScalable* is TRUE, specifies the base angle from which the angle of the directional line is calculated, or that, if *isAngleScalable* is FALSE, specifies the angle of the directional line. The angle is measured from the top of the rectangle that is specified by rect and must be in degrees. The gradient follows the directional line. |
| *isAngleScalable* | BOOL value that specifies whether the angle is scalable. If isAngleScalable is TRUE, the angle of the directional line is scalable; otherwise, the angle is not scalable. |

# <a name="GetBlendLGBrush"></a>GetBlend (CGpLinearGradientBrush)

Gets the blend factors and their corresponding blend positions from a **LinearGradientBrush** object.

```
FUNCTION GetBlend (BYVAL blendFactors AS SINGLE PTR, BYVAL blendPositions AS SINGLE PTR, _
   BYVAL count AS LONG) AS GpStatus
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *blendFactors* | Pointer to an array that receives the blend factors. Each number in the array indicates a percentage of the ending color and is in the range from 0.0 through 1.0. |
| *blendPositions* | Pointer to an array that receives the blend positions. Each number in the array indicates a percentage of the distance between the starting boundary and the ending boundary and is in the range from 0.0 through 1.0, where 0.0 indicates the starting boundary of the gradient and 1.0 indicates the ending boundary. A blend position between 0.0 and 1.0 indicates a line, parallel to the boundary lines, that is a certain fraction of the distance from the starting boundary to the ending boundary. For example, a blend position of 0.7 indicates the line that is 70 percent of the distance from the starting boundary to the ending boundary. The color is constant on lines that are parallel to the boundary lines. |
| *count* | Integer that specifies the number of blend factors to retrieve. Before calling the **GetBlend** method of a **LinearGradientBrush** object, call the **GetBlendCount** method of that same **LinearGradientBrush** object to determine the current number of blend factors. The number of blend positions retrieved is the same as the number of blend factors retrieved. |

#### Return value

If the function succeeds, it returns **Ok**, which is an element of the **Status** enumeration.

If the function fails, it returns one of the other elements of the **Status** enumeration.

#### Remarks

A **LinearGradientBrush** object has two parallel boundaries: a starting boundary and an ending boundary. A color is associated with each of these two boundaries. Each boundary is a straight line that passes through a specified point ‚Äî the starting boundary passes through the starting point; the ending boundary passes through the ending point ‚Äî and is perpendicular to the direction of the linear gradient brush. The direction of the linear gradient brush follows the line that is defined by the starting and ending points. This line, the "directional line," may be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. All points that lie on a line that is parallel to the boundaries are the same color. When you fill an area with a linear gradient brush, the color changes gradually from one line to the next as you move along the directional line from the starting boundary to the ending boundary. By default, the change in color is proportional to the change in distance; that is, a line 30 percent of the distance between the starting boundary and the ending boundary has a color that is 30 percent of the distance between the starting boundary color and the ending boundary color. The color pattern is repeated outside of the starting and ending boundaries.

You can call the **SetBlend** method of a LinearGradientBrush object to customize the relationship between color and distance. For example, suppose you set the blend positions to {0, 0.5, 1} and you set the blend factors to {0, 0.3, 1}. Then a line 50 percent of the distance between the starting boundary and the ending boundary will have a color that is 30 percent of the distance between the starting boundary color and the ending boundary color.

#### Example

```
FUNCTION GetBlend (BYVAL blendFactors AS SINGLE PTR, BYVAL blendPositions AS SINGLE PTR, _
   BYVAL count AS LONG) AS GpStatus
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *blendFactors* | Pointer to an array that receives the blend factors. |
| *blendPositions* | Pointer to an array that receives the blend positions. |
| *count* | Integer that specifies the number of blend factors to retrieve. Before calling the **GetBlend** method of a **PathGradientBrush** object, call the **GetBlendCount** method of that same **PathGradientBrush** object to determine the current number of blend factors. The number of blend positions retrieved is the same as the number of blend factors retrieved. |

#### Return value

If the function succeeds, it returns **Ok**, which is an element of the **Status** enumeration.

If the function fails, it returns one of the other elements of the **Status** enumeration.

#### Remarks

A **PathGradientBrush** object has a boundary path and a center point. When you fill an area with a path gradient brush, the color changes gradually as you move from the boundary path to the center point. By default, the color is linearly related to the distance, but you can customize the relationship between color and distance by calling the SetBlend method.

#### Return value

FUNCTION GetFocusScales (BYVAL xScale AS SINGLE PTR, BYVAL yScale AS SINGLE PTR) AS GpStatus
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *xScale* | Pointer to a simple precision that receives the x focus scale value. |
| *yScale* | Pointer to a simple precision that receives the y focus scale value. |

#### Return value

If the function succeeds, it returns **Ok**, which is an element of the **Status** enumeration.

If the function fails, it returns one of the other elements of the **Status** enumeration.

#### Remarks

By default, the center color of a path gradient is at the center point. By calling **SetFocusScales**, you can specify that the center color should appear along a path that surrounds the center point. For example, suppose the boundary path is a triangle and the center point is at the centroid of that triangle. Also assume that the boundary color is red and the center color is blue. If you set the focus scales to (0.2, 0.2), the color is blue along the boundary of a small triangle that surrounds the center point. That small triangle is the main boundary path scaled by a factor of 0.2 in the x direction and 0.2 in the y direction. When you paint with the path gradient brush, the color will change gradually from red to blue as you move from the boundary of the large triangle to the boundary of the small triangle. The area inside the small triangle will be filled with blue.

#### Example

```
' ========================================================================================
' The following example creates a PathGradientBrush object based on a triangular path.
' The code sets the focus scales of the path gradient brush to (0.2, 0.2) and then uses
' the path gradient brush to fill an area that contains the triangular path. Finally, the

#### Return value

This method returns the number of colors to be interpolated for this linear gradient brush. If no colors have been set by using **SetInterpolationColors**, or if invalid positions were passed to **SetInterpolationColors**, then **GetInterpolationColorCount** returns 0.

#### Remarks

A simple linear gradient brush has two colors: a color at the starting boundary and a color at the ending boundary. When you paint with such a brush, the color changes gradually from the starting color to the ending color as you move from the starting boundary to the ending boundary. You can create a more complex gradient by using the **SetInterpolationColors** method to specify an array of colors and their corresponding blend positions to be interpolated for this linear gradient brush.

You can obtain the colors and blend positions currently set for a linear gradient brush by calling its **GetInterpolationColors** method. Before you call the **GetInterpolationColors** method, you must allocate two buffers: one to hold the array of colors and one to hold the array of blend positions. You can call the **GetInterpolationColorCount** method to determine the required size of those buffers. The size of the colors buffer is the return value of **GetInterpolationColorCount** multiplied by **sizeof(Color)**. The size of the blend positions buffer is the value of **GetInterpolationColorCount** multiplied by **sizeof(REAL)**.

When you paint with such a brush, the color changes gradually from the boundary color to the center color as you move from the boundary path to the center point. You can create a more complex gradient by specifying an array of preset colors and an array of blend positions.

You can obtain the interpolation colors and interpolation positions currently set for a **PathGradientBrush** object by calling the **GetInterpolationColors** method of that **PathGradientBrush** object. Before you call the **GetInterpolationColors** method, you must allocate two buffers: one to hold the array of interpolation colors and one to hold the array of interpolation positions. You can call the **GetInterpolationColorCount** method of the **PathGradientBrush** object to determine the required size of those buffers. The size of the color buffer is the return value of **GetInterpolationColorCount** multiplied by 4. The size of the position buffer is the value of **GetInterpolationColorCount** multiplied by 4 (the size of a simple precision number).

Gets the blend factors and their corresponding blend positions from a **LinearGradientBrush** object.

```
FUNCTION GetInterpolationColors (BYVAL presetColors AS ARGB PTR, _
   BYVAL blendPositions AS SINGLE PTR, BYVAL count AS LONG) AS GpStatus
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *presetColors* | Pointer to an array that receives the colors. A color of a given index in the presetColors array corresponds to the blend position of that same index in the *blendPositions* array. |
| *blendPositions* | Pointer to an array that receives the blend positions. Each number in the array indicates a percentage of the distance between the starting boundary and the ending boundary and is in the range from 0.0 through 1.0, where 0.0 indicates the starting boundary of the gradient and 1.0 indicates the ending boundary. A blend position between 0.0 and 1.0 indicates a line, parallel to the boundary lines, that is a certain fraction of the distance from the starting boundary to the ending boundary. For example, a blend position of 0.7 indicates the line that is 70 percent of the distance from the starting boundary to the ending boundary. The color is constant on lines that are parallel to the boundary lines. |
| *count* | Integer that specifies the number of elements in the presetColors array. This is the same as the number of elements in the blendPositions array. Before calling the **GetInterpolationColors** method of a **LinearGradientBrush** object, call the **GetInterpolationColorCount** method of that same **LinearGradientBrush** object to determine the current number of colors. The number of blend positions retrieved is the same as the number of colors retrieved. |

#### Return value

If the function succeeds, it returns **Ok**, which is an element of the **Status** enumeration.

If the function fails, it returns one of the other elements of the **Status** enumeration.

#### Example

```
' ========================================================================================
' The following example sets the colors that are interpolated for this linear gradient
' brush to red, blue, and green and sets the blend positions to 0, 0.3, and 1. The code
' calls the LinearGradientBrush::GetInterpolationColorCount method of a LinearGradientBrush
' object to obtain the number of colors currently set to be interpolated for the brush.
' Next, the code gets the colors and their positions. Then, the code fills a small
' rectangle with each color.
