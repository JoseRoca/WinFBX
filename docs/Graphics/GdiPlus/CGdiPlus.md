# CGdiPlus

GDI+ is the successor to GDI, the graphics device interface included with earlier versions of Windows. Windows XP or Windows .NET Server supports GDI for compatibility with existing applications, but programmers of new applications should use GDI+ for all their graphics needs because GDI+ optimizes many of the capabilities of GDI and also provides additional features.

A graphics device interface, such as GDI+, allows application programmers to display information on a screen or printer without having to be concerned about the details of a particular display device. The application programmer makes calls to the provided functions and those functions in turn make the appropriate calls to specific device drivers. GDI+ insulates the application from the graphics hardware, and it is this insulation that allows developers to create device-independent applications.

**Include file**: CGdiPlus.inc.

# CGpBase class

Initializes the GDI+ library and keeps a reference count of it. The destructor shutdowns the library. All the other GDI+ classes inherit frrom **CGpBase**.

### GetLastStatus method

Returns a value that indicates the nature of this object's most recent method failure.

```
FUNCTION GetLastStatus () AS GpStatus
```

#### Return value

Returns an element of the **Status** enumeration.

If no methods invoked on this object have failed since the previous call to **GetLastStatus**, then **GetLastStatus** returns **Ok** (0). If at least one method has failed since the previous call to **GetLastStatus**, then **GetLastStatus** returns a value that indicates the nature of the most recent failure.

For a detailed list of status codes see the **Status** enumeration.

# <a name="BitmapData"></a>BitmapData Structure

A **BitmapData** structure stores attributes of a bitmap. Used by the **GdipBitmapLockBits** and **GdipBitmapUnlockBits** functions.

```
TYPE BitmapData
   Width AS UINT
   Height AS UINT
   Stride AS INT_
   PixelFormat AS PixelFormat
   Scan0 AS ANY PTR
   Reserved AS UINT_PTR
END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **Width** | Number of pixels in one scan line of the bitmap. |
| **Height** | Number of scan lines in the bitmap. |
| **Stride** | Offset, in bytes, between consecutive scan lines of the bitmap. If the stride is positive, the bitmap is top-down. If the stride is negative, the bitmap is bottom-up. |
| **PixelFormat** | Integer that specifies the pixel format of the bitmap. |
| **Scan0** | Pointer to the first (index 0) scan line of the bitmap. |
| **Reserved** | Reserved for future use. |

# <a name="CharacterRange"></a>CharacterRange Structure

A **CharacterRange** structure specifies a range of character positions within a string.

```
TYPE CharacterRange
   First AS INT_
   Length AS INT_
END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **First** | Specifies the first position of this range. |
| **Length** | Specifies the number of positions in this range. |

#### Remarks

A character range is a range of character positions within a string of text. The area of the display that is occupied by a group of characters that are specified by the character range is the bounding region. A character range is set by **GdipSetStringFormatMeasurableCharacterRanges**. The number of ranges that are currently set can be determined by calling **GdipGetStringFormatMeasurableCharacterRangeCount**. This number is also the number of regions expected to be obtained by the **GdipMeasureCharacterRanges** function.

# <a name="ColorMap"></a>ColorMap Structure

The **ColorMap** structure contains two COLORREF values. Several of the **ImageAttributes** functions adjust image colors by using a color remap table, which is an array of **ColorMap** structures.

```
TYPE ColorMap
   oldColor AS Color
   newColor AS Color
END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **oldColor** | The original color. |
| **newColor** | The new color. |

#### Remarks

Because the FreeBasic 32-bit headers don't define the GDI+ **ColorMap** structure ad use the GDI **ColorMap** one, that has different member names, there is a conflict. To solve it, I have defined an union that can be used to replace **ColorMap** in both 32 and 64-bit.

```
UNION GDIP_COLORMAP
   ' // For compatibility with GDI+
   TYPE
      oldColor AS COLORREF
      newColor AS COLORREF
   END TYPE
   ' // For compatibility with GDI
   TYPE
      from AS COLORREF
      to AS COLORREF
   END TYPE
END UNION
```

# <a name="ColorMatrix"></a>ColorMatrix Structure

The **ColorMap** structure contains two COLORREF values. Several of the **ImageAttributes** functions adjust image colors by using a color remap table, which is an array of **ColorMap** structures.

```
TYPE ColorMatrix
   m(0 to 5-1, 0 to 5-1) AS REAL
END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **m** | 5x5 array of real numbers. |

#### Remarks

A 5x5 color matrix is a homogeneous matrix for a 4-space transformation. The element in the fifth row and fifth column of a 5x5 homogeneous matrix must be 1, and all of the other elements in the fifth column must be 0. Color matrices are used to transform color vectors. The first four components of a color vector hold the red, green, blue, and alpha components (in that order) of a color. The fifth component of a color vector is always 1.

# <a name="ColorPalette"></a>ColorPalette Structure

The **ColorPalette** structure defines an array of colors that make up a color palette. The colors are 32-bit ARGB colors.

```
TYPE ColorPalette
   Flags AS UINT
   Count AS UINT

END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **Flags** | Combination of flags from the **PaletteFlags** enumeration. |
| **Count** | Number of elements in the **Entries** array. |
| **Entries** | Array of ARGB colors.  |

# <a name="EncoderParameter"></a>EncoderParameter Structure

An **EncoderParameter** structure holds a parameter that can be passed to an image encoder. An **EncoderParameter** structure can also be used to receive a list of possible values supported by a particular parameter of a particular image encoder.

```
TYPE EncoderParameter
   Guid AS GUID
   NumberOfValues AS ULONG
   Type AS ULONG
   Value AS ANY PTR
END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **Guid** | Identifies the parameter category. GUIDs that represent various parameter categories (**EncoderCompression**, **EncoderColorDepth**, and the like) are defined in Gdiplusimaging.inc. |
| **NumberOfValues** | Number of values in the array pointed to by the **Value** data member. |
| **Type** | Identifies the data type of the parameter. The **EncoderParameterValueType** enumeration in Gdiplusenums.inc defines several possible value types. |
| **Value** | Pointer to an array of values. Each value has the type specified by the **Type** data member. |

# <a name="EncoderParameters"></a>EncoderParameters Structure

An **EncoderParameters** structure is an array of **EncoderParameter** structures along with a data member that specifies the number of **EncoderParameter** structures in the array.

```
TYPE EncoderParameters
   Count AS UINT
   Parameter(0) AS EncoderParameter
END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **Count** | Number of **EncoderParameter** structures in the array. |
| **Parameter ()** | Array of **EncoderParameter** structures. |

#### Remarks

When you create an **EncoderParameters** structure, you must allocate enough memory to hold all of the **EncoderParameter** structures that will eventually be placed in the array.

# <a name="ENHMETAHEADER3"></a>ENHMETAHEADER3 Structure

The **ENHMETAHEADER3** structure contains enhanced-metafile data including the dimensions of the metafile image, the number of records in the metafile, and the resolution of the device on which the metafile was created.

```
TYPE ENHMETAHEADER3
   itype AS DWORD
   nSize AS DWORD
   rclBounds AS RECTL
   rclFrame AS RECTL
   dSignature AS DWORD
   nVersion AS DWORD
   nBytes AS DWORD
   nRecords AS DWORD
   nHandles AS WORD
   sReserved AS WORD
   nDescription AS DWORD
   offDescription AS DWORD
   nPalEntries AS DWORD
   szlDevice AS SIZEL
   szlMillimeters AS SIZEL
END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **iType** | Record type. Value is always EMR_HEADER. |
| **nSize** | Structure size, in bytes. This may be greater than the value returned by SIZEOF (ENHMETAHEADER3). |
| **rclBounds** | Bounding rectangle, in device units, for the image stored in the metafile. |
| **rclFrame** | Rectangle, in 0.01 millimeter units, that surrounds the image stored in the metafile. |
| **dSignature** | Must be ENHMETA_SIGNATURE. |
| **nVersion** | Version number of the metafile format. The current version is &H10000. |
| **nBytes** | Size, in bytes, of the metafile. |
| **nRecords** | Number of records in the metafile. |
| **nHandles** | Number of handles in the metafile handle table. Handle index zero is reserved. |
| **sReserved** | Reserved. Must be zero. |
| **nDescription** | Number of characters in the string that contains the description of the metafile's contents. This member is 0 if the metafile does not have a description string. |
| **offDescription** | Offset from the beginning of the ENHMETAHEADER3 structure to the string that contains the description of the metafile's contents. This member is 0 if the metafile does not have a description string. |
| **nPalEntries** | Number of entries in the metafile palette. |
| **szlDevice** | Resolution, in pixels, of the reference device. |
| **szlMillimeters** | Resolution, in millimeters, of the reference device. |

# <a name="GdiplusStartupInput"></a>GdiplusStartupInput Structure

The **GdiplusStartupInput** structure holds a block of arguments that are required by the **GdiplusStartup** function.

```
TYPE GdiplusStartupInput
   GdiplusVersion AS UINT32
   DebugEventCallback AS DebugEventProc
   SuppressBackgroundThread AS BOOL
   SuppressExternalCodecs AS BOOL
END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **GdiplusVersion** | Specifies the version of Microsoft Windows GDI+. Must be 1. |
| **DebugEventCallback** | Pointer to a callback function that GDI+ can call, on debug builds, for assertions and warnings. The default value is NULL. |
| **SuppressBackgroundThread** | Boolean value that specifies whether to suppress the GDI+ background thread. If you set this member to TRUE, GdiplusStartup returns (in its output parameter) a pointer to a hook function and a pointer to an unhook function. You must call those functions appropriately to replace the background thread. If you do not want to be responsible for calling the hook and unhook functions, set this member to FALSE. The default value is FALSE. |
| **SuppressExternalCodecs** | Boolean value that specifies whether you want GDI+ to suppress external image codecs. GDI+ version 1.0 does not support external image codecs, so this parameter is ignored. |

#### Remarks

The **GdiplusStartupInput** structure provides a constructor that sets the **GdiplusVersion** member to 1 and allows you to specify values for the other three members. All of the constructor parameters are optional, so you can declare a variable of type GdiplusStartupInput without passing any arguments to the constructor, and all of the members will be initialized with appropriate default values.

If you set the **SuppressBackgroundThread** member of the **GdiplusStartupinput** parameter to TRUE, you must call the hook and unhook functions returned in the output parameter. Call those functions before and after the application's main message loop; that is, a message loop that is active for the lifetime of GDI+. Call the hook function before the loop starts, and call the unhook function after the loop ends.

# <a name="GdiplusStartupOutput"></a>GdiplusStartupOutput Structure

The **GdiplusStartup** function uses the **GdiplusStartupOutput** structure to return (in its output parameter) a pointer to a hook function and a pointer to an unhook function. If you set the **SuppressBackgroundThread** member of the input parameter to TRUE, then you are responsible for calling those functions to replace the Microsoft Windows GDI+ background thread.

Call the hook and unhook functions before and after the application's main message loop; that is, a message loop that is active for the lifetime of GDI+. Call the hook function before the loop starts, and call the unhook function after the loop ends. The token parameter of the hook function receives an identifier that you should later pass to the unhook function. If you do not pass the proper identifier (the one returned by the hook function) to the unhook function, there will be resource leaks that won't be cleaned up until the process exits.

If you do not want to be responsible for calling the hook and unhook functions, set the **SuppressBackgroundThread** member of the input parameter (passed to **GdiplusStartup**) to FALSE.

```
TYPE GdiplusStartupOutput
   NotificationHook AS NotificationHookProc
   NotificationUnhook AS NotificationUnhookProc
END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **NotificationHook** | Receives a pointer to a hook function. |
| **NotificationUnhook** | Receives a pointer to an unhook function. |

# <a name="GpPathData"></a>GpPathData Structure

The **GpPathData** structure is used by the **GdipGetPathData** function. It has an array of points and an array of types. Each element in the array of types is a byte that specifies the point type and a set of flags for the corresponding element in the array of points. You can use a **GpathData** structure to get or set the data points (and their types) of a path.

```
TYPE GpPathData
   Count AS INT_
   Points AS GpPointF PTR
   Types AS BYTE PTR
END TYPE
```
-also-
```
type GpPathData as any
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **NotificationHook** | Receives a pointer to a hook function. |
| **NotificationUnhook** | Receives a pointer to an unhook function. |

#### Remarks

Because of another mess in the FreeBASIC Gdi+ headers, this structure can't be used with 32 and 64-bit at the same time. Therefore, I have declared a replacement in AfxGdiPlus.inc.

```
TYPE GDIP_PATHDATA

# <a name="ImageCodecInfo"></a>ImageCodecInfo Structure

An **ImageCodecInfo** structure stores information about an image codec (encoder/decoder). GDI+ provides several built-in image codecs. You can obtain information about those codecs by calling the **GetImageEncoders** function and the **GetImageDecoders** function. Each of those functions returns an array of **ImageCodecInfo** structures, one for each available encoder or decoder.

#### Remarks

Metafiles provide a device-independent and application-independent way to share pictures. They contain records that describe a sequence of graphics application programming interfaces (APIs) to invoke in a particular order with their associated graphics data. Metafiles can be recorded by an application and later played back by that application or by another one to reproduce a particular picture. They can also be used to send content to a print spooler. Enhanced metafiles support the ability to provide both Microsoft Windows GDI+ and Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) descriptions of the same picture so that both GDI+ and down-level GDI applications can render it.

# <a name="WmfPlaceableFileHeader"></a>WmfPlaceableFileHeader Structure

The **WmfPlaceableFileHeader** structure defines the fields of a placeable metafile header. Placeable metafiles were created as a way of specifying how a metafile is mapped and scaled on a display device.

```
TYPE WmfPlaceableFileHeader
   Key AS UINT32
   Hmf AS INT16
   BoundingBox AS PWMFRect16
   Inch AS INT16
   Reserved AS UINT32
   Checksum AS INT16
END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **Key** | Identification value that indicates the presence of a placeable metafile header. This value is always &h9AC6CDD7. |
| **Hmf** | Handle to the metafile in memory. When written to disk, this field is not used and will always contains the value 0. |
| **BoundingBox** | Destination rectangle, measured in twips, for displaying the metafile. |
| **Inch** | Number of twips per inch used to represent the image.<br>Normally, there are 1440 twips per inch; however, this number can be changed to scale the image.<br>* A value of 720 specifies that the image is twice its normal size.<br>* A value of 360 specifies that the image is four times its normal size.<br>* A value of 2880 specifies that the image is half its normal size. |
| **Reserved** | Not used and is always set to 0. |
| **Checksum** | Checksum for the previous 10 WORDs in the header. This value can be used to determine whether the metafile has become corrupted. |

#### Remarks

Although placeable metafiles are quite common, they are not directly supported by the Microsoft Windows application programming interface (API). To display a placeable metafile using the Windows API, you must first strip the placeable metafile header from the file. This is typically performed by copying the metafile to a temporary file starting at file offset 22 (0x16). This is because each placeable metafile begins with a 22-byte header that is followed by a standard metafile. 

# <a name="BrushType"></a>BrushType Enumeration

The **BrushType** enumeration indicates the type of brush. There are five types of brushes.

```
BrushTypeSolidColor = 0
BrushTypeHatchFill = 1
BrushTypeTextureFill = 2
BrushTypePathGradient = 3
BrushTypeLinearGradient = 4
```

| Constant   | Meaning     |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **BrushTypeSolidColor** | Indicates a brush of type SolidBrush. A solid brush paints a single, constant color that can be opaque or transparent. |
| **BrushTypeHatchFill** | Indicates a brush of type **HatchBrush**. A hatch brush paints a background and paints, over that background, a pattern of lines, dots, dashes, squares, crosshatch, or some variation of these. The hatch brush consists of two colors: one for the background and one for the pattern over the background. The color of the background is called the background color, and the color of the pattern is called the foreground color.  |
| **BrushTypeTextureFill** | Indicates a brush of type **TextureBrush**. A texture brush paints an image. The image or texture is either a portion of a specified image or a scaled version of a specified image. The type of image (metafile or nonmetafile) determines whether the texture is a portion of the image or a scaled version of the image. |
| **BrushTypePathGradient** | Indicates a brush of type **PathGradientBrush**. A path gradient brush paints a color gradient in which the color changes from a center point outward to a boundary that is defined by a closed curve or path. The color gradient has one color at the center point and one or multiple colors at the boundary. |
| **BrushTypeLinearGradient** | Indicates a brush of type **LinearGradientBrush**. A linear gradient brush paints a color gradient in which the color changes evenly from the starting boundary line of the linear gradient brush to the ending boundary line of the linear gradient brush. The boundary lines of a linear gradient brush are two parallel straight lines. The color gradient is perpendicular to the boundary lines of the linear gradient brush, changing gradually across the stroke from the starting boundary line to the ending boundary line. The color gradient has one color at the starting boundary line and another color at the ending boundary line.  |

CompositingModeSourceCopy = 1
```

| Constant   | Meaning     |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| CompositingModeSourceOver | Specifies that when a color is rendered, it is blended with the background color. The blend is determined by the alpha component of the color being rendered. |
| CompositingModeSourceCopy | Specifies that when a color is rendered, it overwrites the background color. This mode cannot be used along with **TextRenderingHintClearTypeGridFit**. |

# <a name="CompositingQuality"></a>CompositingQuality Enumeration

| CompositingQualityHighQuality | Specifies that gamma correction is applied. |
| CompositingQualityGammaCorrected | Specifies that gamma correction is applied. |
| CompositingQualityAssumeLinear | Specifies that gamma correction is not applied. |

#### Remarks

When you specify that gamma correction should not be applied, the image data to be rendered (blended with the background) is assumed to be in a linear color space with a gamma value of 1.0. As a result, no gamma adjustment is applied to the image data before or after blending the image with the background.

When you specify that gamma correction should be applied, the image data to be rendered (blended with the background) is assumed to be in the sRGB color space with a gamma value of 2.2. To ensure accurate blending, the input image data is transformed into a linear (gamma = 1.0) space before the colors are blended and transformed back into sRGB (gamma = 2.2) space afterward. This mode results in a more accurate blend at the expense of additional processing time. 

# <a name="CoordinateSpace"></a>CoordinateSpace Enumeration

```

| Constant   | Meaning     |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| DriverStringOptionsCmapLookup | Specifies that the positions of the glyphs are taken from a character map lookup table. If this flag is not set, the positions are taken from an array of coordinates. |
| DriverStringOptionsVertical | Specifies that the string is displayed vertically. |
| DriverStringOptionsRealizedAdvance | Specifies that the glyph positions are calculated from the position of the first glyph. If this flag is not set, the glyph positions are obtained from an array of coordinates. |
| DriverStringOptionsLimitSubpixel | Specifies that less memory should be used for cache of antialiased glyphs. This also produces lower quality. If this flag is set, more memory is used, but the quality is higher. |

# <a name="EmfToWmfBitsFlags"></a>EmfToWmfBitsFlags Enumeration

Specifies options for the **GdipEmfToWmfBits** method, which converts an Enhanced Metafile (EMF) metafile to a Microsoft Windows Metafile Format (WMF) metafile.

| EmfToWmfBitsFlagsEmbedEmf | Specifies that the source EMF metafile is embedded as a comment in the resulting WMF metafile.|
| EmfToWmfBitsFlagsIncludePlaceable | Specifies that the resulting WMF metafile is in the placeable metafile format; that is, it has the additional 22-byte header required by a placeable metafile. |
| EmfToWmfBitsFlagsNoXORClip | Specifies that the clipping region is stored in the metafile in the traditional way. If you do not set this flag, the **GdipEmfToWmfBits** function applies an optimization that stores the clipping region as a path and simulates clipping by using the XOR operator. |

# <a name="EmfType"></a>EmfType Enumeration

The grayscale histogram is written to the buffer pointed to by the channel0 parameter of the **GdipBitmapGetHistogram** function. The channel1, channel2, and channel3 parameters must be set to NULL. |
| HistogramFormatB | Specifies that the **GdipBitmapGetHistogram** function returns a histogram for the blue channel. The blue-channel histogram is written to the buffer pointed to by the channel0 parameter of the **GdipBitmapGetHistogram** function. The channel1, channel2, and channel3 parameters must be set to NULL. |
| HistogramFormatG | Specifies that the **GdipBitmapGetHistogram** function returns a histogram for the green channel.

# <a name="HotkeyPrefix"></a>HotkeyPrefix Enumeration

The **HotkeyPrefix** enumeration specifies how to display hot keys. There are three options: do nothing, display hot keys underlined, and hide the hot key underlines.

```
HotkeyPrefixNone = 0
HotkeyPrefixShow = 1
HotkeyPrefixHide = 2
```

| Constant   | Meaning     |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| HotkeyPrefixNone | Specifies that no hot key processing occurs. |
| HotkeyPrefixShow | Specifies that Unicode text is scanned for ampersands (&), which are interpreted as hot key markers in the same way as menu and dialog resources are processed in the Windows user interface. All pairs of ampersands are replaced by a single ampersand. All single ampersands are removed and the first character that follows the first single ampersand is displayed underlined. |
| HotkeyPrefixHide | Specifies that Unicode text is scanned for ampersands (&), which are substituted and removed as in HotkeyPrefixShow but no underline is shown. This option can be used when accessibility hot key underlines are not required. |

#### Remarks

Hot keys are keys that are programmed to provide keyboard shortcuts to functionality and are activated by pressing the ALT key. The keys are application dependent and are identified by an underscored letter, typically in a menu. An example would be the File menu with the letter F underscored. This makes the F key a hot key to launch the File menu.

# <a name="ImageFlags"></a>ImageFlags Enumeration

ImageLockModeWrite        = &H0002
ImageLockModeUserInputBuf = &H0004
```

| Constant   | Meaning     |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| ImageLockModeRead | Specifies that a portion of the image is locked for reading. |
| ImageLockModeWrite | Specifies that a portion of the image is locked for writing. |
| ImageLockModeUserInputBuf | Specifies that the buffer used for reading or writing pixel data is allocated by the user.

# <a name="StringFormatFlags"></a>StringFormatFlags Enumeration

The **StringFormatFlags** enumeration specifies text layout information (such as orientation and clipping) and display manipulations (such as ellipsis insertion, digit substitution, and representation of characters that are not supported by a font).

```
StringFormatFlagsDirectionRightToLeft  = &h00000001
StringFormatFlagsDirectionVertical     = &h00000002
StringFormatFlagsNoFitBlackBox         = &h00000004
StringFormatFlagsDisplayFormatControl  = &h00000020
StringFormatFlagsNoFontFallback        = &h00000400
StringFormatFlagsMeasureTrailingSpaces = &h00000800
StringFormatFlagsNoWrap                = &h00001000
StringFormatFlagsLineLimit             = &h00002000
StringFormatFlagsNoClip                = &h00004000
```

| Constant   | Meaning     |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| StringFormatFlagsDirectionRightToLeft | Specifies that reading order is right to left. For horizontal text, characters are read from right to left. For vertical text, columns are read from right to left. By default, horizontal or vertical text is read from left to right. |
| StringFormatFlagsDirectionVertical | Specifies that individual lines of text are drawn vertically on the display device. By default, lines of text are horizontal, each new line below the previous line. |
| StringFormatFlagsNoFitBlackBox | Specifies that parts of characters are allowed to overhang the string's layout rectangle. By default, characters are first aligned inside the rectangle's boundaries, then any characters which still overhang the boundaries are repositioned to avoid any overhang and thereby avoid affecting pixels outside the layout rectangle. An italic, lowercase letter F ( f) is an example of a character that may have overhanging parts. Setting this flag ensures that the character aligns visually with the lines above and below but may cause parts of characters, which lie outside the layout rectangle, to be clipped or painted. |
| StringFormatFlagsDisplayFormatControl | Specifies that Unicode layout control characters are displayed with a representative character. |
| StringFormatFlagsNoFontFallback | Specifies that an alternate font is used for characters that are not supported in the requested font. By default, any missing characters are displayed with the "fonts missing" character, usually an open square. |
| StringFormatFlagsMeasureTrailingSpaces | Specifies that the space at the end of each line is included in a string measurement. By default, the boundary rectangle returned by the GdipMeasureString function excludes the space at the end of each line. Set this flag to include that space in the measurement. |
| StringFormatFlagsNoWrap | Specifies that the wrapping of text to the next line is disabled. NoWrap is implied when a point of origin is used instead of a layout rectangle. When drawing text within a rectangle, by default, text is broken at the last word boundary that is inside the rectangle's boundary and wrapped to the next line. |
| StringFormatFlagsLineLimit | Specifies that only entire lines are laid out in the layout rectangle. By default, layout continues until the end of the text or until no more lines are visible as a result of clipping, whichever comes first. The default settings allow the last line to be partially obscured by a layout rectangle that is not a whole multiple of the line height. To ensure that only whole lines are seen, set this flag and be careful to provide a layout rectangle at least as tall as the height of one line. |
| StringFormatFlagsNoClip | Specifies that characters overhanging the layout rectangle and text extending outside the layout rectangle are allowed to show. By default, all overhanging characters and text that extends outside the layout rectangle are clipped. Any trailing spaces (spaces that are at the end of a line) that extend outside the layout rectangle are clipped. Therefore, the setting of this flag will have an effect on a string measurement if trailing spaces are being included in the measurement. If clipping is enabled, trailing spaces that extend outside the layout rectangle are not included in the measurement. If clipping is disabled, all trailing spaces are included in the measurement, regardless of whether they are outside the layout rectangle. |

#### Remarks

Multiple flags set can produce combined effects: 

When both **StringFormatFlagsDirectionVertical** and **StringFormatFlagsDirectionRightToLeft** are set, individual lines of text are drawn vertically. The first line starts at the right edge of the layout rectangle; the second line of text is to the left of the first line, and so on. 

When **StringFormatFlagsDirectionVertical** is set and **StringFormatFlagsDirectionRightToLeft** is not set, individual lines of text are drawn vertically. The first line starts at the left edge of the layout rectangle; the second line of text is to the right of the first line. 

When **StringFormatFlagsDirectionRightToLeft** is set and **StringFormatFlagsDirectionVertical** is not set, the individual lines of text are horizontal and the reading order is from right to left. This setting does not change the order in which characters are displayed, it simply specifies the order in which characters can be read. 

The **StringFormatFlagsDirectionVertical** and **StringFormatFlagsDirectionRightToLeft** flags can affect string alignment.

The StringTrimming enumeration specifies how to trim characters from a string so that the string fits into a layout rectangle. The layout rectangle is used to position and size the display string.

# <a name="StringTrimming"></a>StringTrimming Enumeration

```
StringTrimmingNone = 0
StringTrimmingCharacter = 1
StringTrimmingWord = 2
StringTrimmingEllipsisCharacter = 3
StringTrimmingEllipsisWord = 4
StringTrimmingEllipsisPath = 5
```

| Constant   | Meaning     |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| StringTrimmingNone | Specifies that no trimming is done. |
| StringTrimmingCharacter | Specifies that the string is broken at the boundary of the last character that is inside the layout rectangle. This is the default. |
| StringTrimmingWord | Specifies that the string is broken at the boundary of the last word that is inside the layout rectangle. |
| StringTrimmingEllipsisCharacter | Specifies that the string is broken at the boundary of the last character that is inside the layout rectangle and an ellipsis (...) is inserted after the character. |
| StringTrimmingEllipsisWord | Specifies that the string is broken at the boundary of the last word that is inside the layout rectangle and an ellipsis (...) is inserted after the word. |
| StringTrimmingEllipsisPath | Specifies that the center is removed from the string and replaced by an ellipsis. The algorithm keeps as much of the last portion of the string as possible. |

#### Remarks

Trimming affects only the last visible or partly visible (due to clipping) line of text.

# <a name="TestControl"></a>TestControl Enumeration

```
TestControlForceBilinear = 0
TestControlNoICM = 1
TestControlGetBuildNumber = 2
```

# <a name="TextRenderingHint"></a>TextRenderingHint Enumeration

The enumeration specifies the process used to render text. The process affects the quality of the text.

```
TextRenderingHintSystemDefault            = 0
TextRenderingHintSingleBitPerPixelGridFit = 1
TextRenderingHintSingleBitPerPixel        = 2
TextRenderingHintAntiAliasGridFit         = 3
TextRenderingHintAntiAlias                = 4
TextRenderingHintClearTypeGridFit         = 5
```

| Constant   | Meaning     |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| TextRenderingHintSystemDefault | Specifies that a character is drawn using the currently selected system font smoothing mode (also called a rendering hint). |
| TextRenderingHintSingleBitPerPixelGridFit | Specifies that a character is drawn using its glyph bitmap and hinting to improve character appearance on stems and curvature. |
| TextRenderingHintSingleBitPerPixel | Specifies that a character is drawn using its glyph bitmap and no hinting. This results in better performance at the expense of quality. |
| TextRenderingHintAntiAliasGridFit | Specifies that a character is drawn using its antialiased glyph bitmap and hinting. This results in much better quality due to antialiasing at a higher performance cost. |
| TextRenderingHintAntiAlias | Specifies that a character is drawn using its antialiased glyph bitmap and no hinting. Stem width differences may be noticeable because hinting is turned off. |
| TextRenderingHintClearTypeGridFit | Specifies that a character is drawn using its glyph Microsoft ClearType bitmap and hinting. This type of text rendering cannot be used along with **CompositingModeSourceCopy**. Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 only: **ClearType** rendering is supported only on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Therefore, **TextRenderingHintClearTypeGridFit** is ignored on other operating systems even though Windows GDI+ is supported on those operating systems. |

#### Remarks

The quality associated with each process varies according to the circumstances. **TextRenderingHintClearTypeGridFit** provides the best quality for most LCD monitors and relatively small font sizes. **TextRenderingHintAntiAlias** provides the best quality for rotated text. Generally, a process that produces higher quality text is slower than a process that produces lower quality text.

# <a name="Unit"></a>Unit Enumeration

The **Unit** enumeration specifies the unit of measure for a given data type.

```
UnitWorld      = 0
UnitDisplay    = 1
UnitPixel      = 2

# <a name="Constants3"></a>Image Frame Dimension Constants 

The Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) image file formats enable you to store multiple frames in a single image file. Multiple frames in a GIF file are used for animation, so the frames are said to be in the time dimension. Multiple frames in a TIFF file are typically used as separate pages, so the frames are said to be in the page dimension. 

The following constants represent globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) that identify the page and time dimensions. 

```
FrameDimensionTime       = "{6AEDBD6D-3FB5-418A-83A6-7F45229DC872}"

| PropertyTagTypeUndefinedÂ | Specifies that the value data member is an array of bytes that can hold values of any data type. |

# <a name="Constants6"></a>Image Property Tag Constants

Several image file formats enable you to store metadata along with an image. Metadata is information about an image, for example, title, width, camera model, and artist. Microsoft Windows GDI+ provides a uniform way of storing and retrieving metadata from image files in the Tagged Image File Format (TIFF), JPEG, Portable Network Graphics (PNG), and Exchangeable Image File (EXIF) formats.

In GDI+, a piece of metadata is called a property item, and an individual property item is identified by a numerical constant called a property tag. You can store and retrieve metadata by calling the **GdipSetPropertyItem** and **GdipGetPropertyItem** functions, and you don't have to be concerned with the details of how a particular file format stores that metadata.

The following table lists the Microsoft Windows GDI+ image property tags in numerical order.
