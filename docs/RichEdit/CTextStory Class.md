### ITextStory Interface

The **ITextStory** interface methods are used to access shared data from multiple stories, which is stored in the parent **ITextServices** instance.

The stories can be "edited" simultaneously by using individual **ITextRange2** methods, and displayed independently of one another. In addition, one story at a time can be UI active; that is, it receives keyboard and mouse input.

The **ITextStory** is a lightweight interface that does not require an **ITextRange2** object. This allows the client to manipulate a story, which is a faster, smaller object than a complete editing instance.
