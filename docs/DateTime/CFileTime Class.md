# CFileTime Class

This class provides methods for managing the date and time values associated with the creation, access and modification of files. The methods and data of this class are frequently used in conjunction with **CFileTimeSpan** objects, which deal with relative time values.

The date and time value is stored as a 64-bit value representing the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since January 1, 1601. This is the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format.

The following static const member variables are provided to simplify calculations (number of 100-nanosecond intervals):

```
CFileTime_Millisecond    10,000
CFileTime_Second         CFileTime_Millisecond * 1,000
CFileTime_Minute         CFileTime_Second * 60
CFileTime_Hour           CFileTime_Minute * 60
CFileTime_Day            CFileTime_Hour * 24
CFileTime_Week           CFileTime_Day * 7
```

**Note**: Not all file systems can record creation and last access time and not all file systems record them in the same manner. For example, on the Windows NT FAT file system, create time has a resolution of 10 milliseconds, write time has a resolution of 2 seconds, and access time has a resolution of 1 day (the access date). On NTFS, access time has a resolution of 1 hour. Furthermore, FAT records times on disk in local time, but NTFS records times on disk in UTC.

# CFileTimeSpan Class

This class provides methods for managing relative periods of time often encountered when performing operations concerning when a file was created, last accessed or last modified. The methods of this class are frequently used in conjunction with CFileTime class objects.

The CFileTimeSpan object can be created using an existing CFileTimeSpan object, or expressed as a 64-bit value. The default constructor sets the time span to 0.

The # flag may prefix any formatting code. In that case, the meaning of the format code is changed as follows.

* %#a, %#A, %#b, %#B, %#p, %#X, %#z, %#Z, %#%: # flag is ignored.
* %#c: Long date and time representation, appropriate for current locale. For example: "Tuesday, March 14, 1995, 12:41:29".
